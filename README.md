The Java program is designed to facilitate financial transfers between accounts by parsing input files in either JSON or XML format. 
Upon execution, the program prompts the user to input the directory path containing the parsing files. It processes all files within 
the specified directory and generates a report in the form of a text file with the results of the operation. Additionally, the program 
allows users to request a list of transactions through a menu interface. Users can choose between two options: 1) invoking the parser and 
2) displaying all transactions. The JSON and XML files must include fields such as source account number, destination account number, 
and the transfer amount. The output text file includes timestamped entries indicating the success or failure of each file processing operation.
